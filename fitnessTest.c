// Selection of MPCS exams include a fitness test which is conducted on ground. There will be a batch of 3 trainees, appearing for running test in track for 3 rounds. You need to record their oxygen level after every round. After trainee are finished with all rounds, calculate for each trainee his average oxygen level over the 3 rounds and select one with highest oxygen level as the most fit trainee. If more than one trainee attains the same highest average level, theyall need to be selected.

// Display the most fit trainee (or trainees) and the highest average oxygen level.
// Note:
//   ->The oxygen value entered should not be accepted if it is not in the range between 1 and 100.
//   ->If the calculated maximum average oxygen value of trainees is below 70 then declare the trainees as unfit with meaningful message as â€œAll trainees are unfit.
//   ->Average Oxygen Values should be rounded.
